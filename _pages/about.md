About me
======  
Welcome to my [Homepage](https://xd-w.github.io)! I am Xudong Wang (王旭东), currently, a Phd student in Computer Science programme from School of Data Science (SDS), The Chinese University of Hongkong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen). Before that, I got the M.Sc. in Data Science from CUHK-Shenzhen in 2022. And in 2020, I got B.Sc. in Statistics from School of Mathematics and B.Ec. in Finance from School of Economics of Shandong University (SDU) respectively.

My research interests and fields are Artificial intelligence(AI), Machine Learning(ML), Matrix-tensor Factorization and Sparse Optimization, Smart Grid. Both my Master and Phd supervisor is [Prof. Chris Ding](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/197) [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q7FfnjgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao)].
